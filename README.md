# Matcha-GNN
The Matcha-GNN framework empowers GNNs structural representation power with meaningful semantic embeddings extracted from ontological information.


## Setup and Run experiments
Either run the run_docker.sh (that creates a docker container to perform the experiments on) or the run.sh executable file to setup the environment and run the experiments.


## Baselines
Test cases:
- no training
- w/ 5 training examples
- full baseline (w/ training)

## Implementations/Future Work
- (future work) prepare matcha framework receival
